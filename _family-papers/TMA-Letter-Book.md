title: Personal Letter Book of Thomas Mountford Adie
excerpt: A transcription of letters written by T M Adie.
---

It was the habit of Thomas Mountford Adie (1815-1884) to take a copy of letters he sent.
He did this using a "letter book" containing blank translucent paper.
The handwritten letter, with the ink still damp, was placed between the sheets, which were then pressed down.
The effect was to transfer the ink to the translucent paper, simultaneously blotting excess ink from the letter.
The result was an exact copy, which could be read through the translucent paper from the opposite side.

There were two letter books, kept in a locked compartment within the massive safe in the main office of T M Adie & Sons.
After their retirement, my parents took them and pored over the faded brown script.
My mother transcribed them onto a computer, and the PDF file below is the result.
I think this file, covering the period 1859 - 1881, represents just one of the books.
Both letter books, and a hard copy of this transcription, are with the Shetland Archives.
