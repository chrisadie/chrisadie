I've been using [Heredis](https://home.heredis.com/en/) to collect all the core genealogical information. Here is the [exported GED file][def] from Heredis.

Another place with lots of Adie family relationships is [Bayanne](https://bayanne.info/Shetland/). Search for [Adie as a surname](https://bayanne.info/Shetland/search.php?mybool=AND&myfirstname=&mylastname=adie&imageField.x=15&imageField.y=13).
