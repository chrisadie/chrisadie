The family firm of T M Adie and Sons was founded in Voe, Shetland around 1830 by my great-great-grandfather Thomas Mountford Adie. There is a book, [“Inside the Postcard – Working life at Adie’s, Voe”](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Inside-Postcard-Laureen-Johnson/dp/1898852782/ref=sr_1_2/202-6704317-5991821?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1182440401&sr=8-2) by Laureen Johnson, which touches on some of the history.

The [Shetland Museum](https://www.shetlandmuseumandarchives.org.uk/) has many [digitised photos](https://photos.shetlandmuseumandarchives.org.uk/) taken by and of members of the family. The Museum also has a wide range of artefacts relating to the firm, donated by my late father, James A Adie.

The original version of this post, written in June 2007 was located at [chrisadie.wordpress.com](chrisadie.wordpress.com). However, the links are now mostly broken. I have pretty much abandoned that site, but don't want to take it down because of [the interesting comments on the post](https://chrisadie.wordpress.com/2007/06/21/t-m-adie-and-sons/#comments).
