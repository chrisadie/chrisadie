I completed this biography of John Adie in 2018. There are two versions:

* [The HTML version][def2]. I will try to keep this version up-to-date with any further information I glean.
* The edited version, published in the New Shetlander in two parts:
  * [Part 1][def4] (Yule 2018)
  * [Part 2][def5] (Voar 2019)
