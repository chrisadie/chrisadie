I have been a member of a writing group for a couple of years.
These are some short stories (or flash fiction) I've written.
Feel free to like or dislike them.

* [The Architect](/assets/fiction/The-Architect.pdf)\
An early attempt (in more ways than one!).
* [The Cough](/assets/fiction/The-Cough.pdf)\
A spooky one.
* [The Turing Test](/assets/fiction/The-Turing-Test.pdf)\
This was a prizewinner in a [u3a short-story competition](https://www.u3a.org.uk/learning/learning-activities/short-story-competition-2023/the-turing-test).
* [The Moebius Affair](/assets/fiction/The-Moebius-Affair.pdf)\
This is the story I'm least unhappy with, I think.
* [The Word-hunter](/assets/fiction/The-Word-hunter.pdf)
* [The Haunting of Charles Dubois](/assets/fiction/The-Haunting-of-Charles-Dubois.pdf)\
Quite pleased with this one too. I have a vague feeling that I've read something like it before - if I've accidentally plagiarised someone's work, I hope they accept my apologies.
* [Annie](/assets/fiction/Annie.pdf)\
She's just an old crook.
