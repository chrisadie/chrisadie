## Â The Adie family of Shetland

### GEDCOM tree

I've been using [Heredis](https://home.heredis.com/en/) to collect all the core genealogical information. Here is the [exported GED file][def] from Heredis.

### John Adie, Surgeon, RN

I completed this biography of John Adie in 2018. There are three versions:

* [The Markdown version][def2]
* [The PDF version][def3]
* The edited version, published in the New Shetlander in two parts:
  * [Part 1][def4] (Yule 2018)
  * [Part 2][def5] (Voar 2019)
