### GEDCOM tree

I've been using [Heredis](https://home.heredis.com/en/) to collect all the core genealogical information. Here is the [exported GED file][def] from Heredis.

### John Adie, Surgeon, RN

I completed this biography of John Adie in 2018. There are three versions:

* [The Markdown version][def2]
* The PDF version
* The edited version, published in the New Shetlander
