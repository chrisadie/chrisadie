I have been a member of a writing group for a couple of years.
These are some poems I've written.
Feel free to like or dislike them.

* [Walk](/assets/poetry/Walk.pdf)\
A sonnet about walking.
* [Seftis-Kotad](/assets/poetry/Seftis-Kotad.pdf)\
A longish narrative poem, fairly dark.
* [Thus and so](/assets/poetry/Thus-and-So.pdf)\
If Emily Dickinson had written about refugees...
* [Heads](/assets/poetry/Heads.pdf)\
An angry Villanelle.
* [What if a longer time we had to live](/assets/poetry/What-if.pdf)\
A sonnet.
